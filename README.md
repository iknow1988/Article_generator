# Atomated Article Generator using NLP and Machine Learning algortihms

This project describes how to join paragraphs together in
longer articles. Independent Paragraphs are described
separately. In many cases, you cannot fully develop a topic in
a single paragraph. Instead, you will find it more useful to
think in terms of groups or clusters of paragraphs within your
essay.

A paragraph cluster is a group of paragraphs that develop
the subtopics of one main idea. There are no rules for the
number of paragraphs that an essay must contain. To decide
whether to divide one main idea into a paragraph cluster, use
the criteria for paragraph unity and coherence.

Article generator is a standalone software to generate
article automatically on a given topic. User only gives the
topic name to the system and gets an output as an article from
the software. It is basically a JAVA application that uses
machine learning algorithms to generate the article. The
process is unsupervised and do not need any data to train the
model. KMeans clustering, Group Average Agglomerative
clustering and word2Vector has been used sequentially to
generate the article.
